      <note type="important">When data loss is not acceptable for a Greenplum Database cluster,
         Greenplum master and segment mirroring is recommended. If mirroring is not enabled then
         Greenplum stores only one copy of the data, so the underlying storage media provides the
         only guarantee for data availability and correctness in the event of a hardware failure.<p
            otherprops="pivotal">With Greenplum for Kubernetes the downtime incurred for replacing a
            failed segment is significantly minimized, and mirrorless deployments are recommended to
            ensure maximum availability for the Greenplum cluster. VMware supports production,
            mirrorless deployments of Greenplum for Kubernetes for this reason. Other deployment
            environments are generally not supported for production use unless both Greenplum master
            and segment mirroring are enabled.</p></note>
